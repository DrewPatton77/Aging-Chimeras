# Project Summary

The healthy brain relies on a dynamic balance between two complementary processes---integration and segregation. Integration enables coordination between distributed brain regions, while segregation reflects specialization. Optimal cognitive function emerges from a highly flexible balance between these processes as implicated by greater cognitive performance. As we age, changes in cognitive abilities occur, especially at older age, while at the same time the brain reorganizes. The exact relationship between the two is largely unknown and our work aims to tackle this challenge. Using a data-informed computational model we examine age-related differences in dynamical flexibility between segregation and integration, as captured by changes in the variable patterns of partial synchronization called chimera states---patterns where some brain regions cooperate while others remain largely independent. Our research shows that chimera states are key to maintaining the brainâ€™s balance between integration and segregation as we age. This balance shifts differently in brain systems responsible for distinct cognitive skills, which may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline and preservation in aging. In particular, it supports the idea that aging affects brain systems differently and that understanding this variability is essential for a more comprehensive view of neuro-cognitive aging.
